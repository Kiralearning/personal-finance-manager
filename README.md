# personal-finance-manager
 The Personal Finance Manager allows users to manage their income and expenses, categorize them, and track their overall financial situation. The goal is to help users keep track of their spending, set budgets, and evaluate their financial health.

# Key Features:

## Add Income/Expenses:
    Users can input their income (e.g., salary, bonus) and expenses (e.g., rent, groceries).
    Each entry should have a category (e.g., food, entertainment, bills) and an amount.

## Track Balance:
    The system will calculate the balance after each transaction.
    Display a running total of the user’s balance.

## View Transaction History:
    Users should be able to see a list of all their income and expense transactions.

## Generate Reports:
    Generate a report of total income, total expenses, and balance for a given time period (e.g., weekly, monthly).

## Budgeting:
    Allow users to set a monthly budget for each category.
    Notify users if they exceed the budget for a particular category.

## Save and Load Data:
    Store transactions in a file (e.g., CSV or JSON) so that users can load the data later.
